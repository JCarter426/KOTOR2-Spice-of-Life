This mod adds spice, a class of narcotic found in the Star Wars galaxy, as a new consumable item type to the game _Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - the Sith Lords_.

Spice may be consumed by any non-droid member of the party, activated as a medical item. Each variety of spice has different effects. Similar to stimulants, the effects of spice do not stack, so only one dose of spice may be used at a time; however, a dose of spice may be used in addition to stimulants and other effects. The effects of spice last for 120 seconds per dose. Use of certain spice leads to withdrawal, which lasts for 30 seconds after the dose wears out. A high Constitution score will reduce the length of withdrawal.

Spice item drops have been placed throughout the game where thematically appropriate. Spice may also be crafted at any lab station.

# Installation

You must start a new game to experience the full effects of this mod.

1. Extract files from the downloaded archive.
2. Run Install.exe.
3. Click "Install Mod" and select your game directory (default name SWKOTOR2).

TSLPatcher may warn that .mod files already existed and were skipped during installation. This is normal and means that this mod's installer patched the files you already had from another mod rather than installing a new one.

This mod only supports the English language version of the game at this time.


# Uninstallation

During installation, TSLPatcher generates a backup folder and a log recording which files were affected.

1. Restore dialog.tlk by copying the file from the backup folder to your game directory, replacing the existing one.
2. Restore or delete all all module files affected by this mod. For each module, copy the corresponding .mod file from the backup folder to your game's Modules folder if it was created, otherwise delete the .mod file from your game's Modules folder.
3. Delete all installed by this mod from your game's Override folder.


# Compatibility

This mod uses combat shot item variations 101 through 112.


# Known Issues

Some effects of spice will stop functioning after you transition areas. It did not seem possible to resolve this without editing the party AI, which would introduce the possibility of compatibility issues with other mods.

While testing, I had an occasional issue with hallucinations being visible after they were supposed to disappear. They will disappear properly after loading the area again. Consider this a symptom of psychosis.
